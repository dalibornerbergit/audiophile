# Audiophile e-commerce website

![Design preview for the Audiophile e-commerce website coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this multi-page e-commerce website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Local `data.json` file is provided for the products.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design file provided. Both Sketch and Figma versions of the design are provided, so you can choose which tool you prefer to use. Designs come with a `README.md` file as well to help you get set up.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some images are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.

The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Only prerequisite is that code is pushed on a GitHub repository.

## Deploying your project

Final site needs to be deployed to  [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Create a custom `README.md`

It's recommended to overwrite this README file with a project specific README
